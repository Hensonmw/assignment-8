''' 
Task 3

In Python, we tend to use for loops over different types of iterators much more
than while loops - they're more flexible and iterators are everywhere in 
Python. Write a program that includes 5 different functions, each of which 
should demonstrate the use of for over different types of iterators. Your 
program should include these five functions, a main() function that calls all 
the other functions, and the ifmain statement.
